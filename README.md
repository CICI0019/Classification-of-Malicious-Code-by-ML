## Intro


## About PEFILE
Refers to a file in a certain format, executable files exe dynamic link library (dll) driver files (sys) are all PE file formatsã€‚
Pefile can parse, read or modify PE files.
- The structure of a PE file when it is stored on disk is different from the structure after it is loaded into memory.
- When the PE file is loaded into the memory through the Windows loader, the version in the memory is called a module (Module).
- The starting address of the mapping file is called the module handle (hModule), also known as the base address (ImageBase).

## Install
````python
pip install pefile
